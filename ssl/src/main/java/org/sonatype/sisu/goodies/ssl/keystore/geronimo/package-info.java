/**
 * This package contains classes originally lifted from the Apache Geronimo project.  These classes need to keep the ASF headers.<BR/><BR/>
 * KeystoreInstance and Exceptions came from geronimo-management: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/geronimo/server/trunk@1211757 <BR/>
 * FileKeystoreInstance from geronimo-security: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/geronimo/server/trunk@1183230
 *
 * These classes contain slight modifications to remove other geronimo dependencies.  We will try to make as few changes to these
 * classes as possible with the hope we can merge in future changes/bug fixes.
