/**
 * Marker interface to categorize a test as requiring some sort of external resource to properly run.
 * <p/>
 * An external resource is a resource not controlled directly by the test or its fixture, for example a public website
 * or
 * internal database or email server running on another host. The resource is not external if it is launched by the
 * testing framework that sets up the test.
 *
 * <p/>
 * External tests should obviously be avoided and are a sign of code smell. But if you have them, it is useful to at
 * least mark them and perhaps run them only on systems which will support the test requirements.
